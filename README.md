<a href = "https://roadmap.sh/projects/todo-list-api">Road Map</a>
In this project you are required to develop a RESTful API to allow users to manage their to-do list. The previous backend projects have only focused on the CRUD operations, but this project will require you to implement user authentication as well.

# Goal
<li>The skills you will learn from this project include:
    <ul>User authentication</ul>
    <ul>Schema design and Databases</ul>
    <ul>RESTful API design</ul>
    <ul>CRUD operations</ul>
    <ul>Error handling</ul>
    <ul>Security</ul>
</li>

# Requirement 
<li> You are required to develop a RESTful API with following endpoints
    <ul>User registration to create a new user</ul>
    <ul>Login endpoint to authenticate the user and generate a token</ul>
    <ul>CRUD operations for managing the to-do list</ul>
    <ul>Implement user authentication to allow only authorized users to access the to-do list</ul>
    <ul>Implement error handling and security measures</ul>
    <ul>Use a database to store the user and to-do list data (you can use any database of your choice)</ul>
    <ul>Implement proper data validation</ul>
    <ul>Implement pagination and filtering for the to-do list</ul>
</li>
